# Neighborhood Sales – C2C E‑Commerce Marketplace

## Overview
Neighborhood Sales is a **customer‑to‑customer (C2C) e‑commerce platform** designed for people within the same city or neighborhood to buy and sell second‑hand goods. The platform focuses on **affordability, safety, reuse, and community**, allowing users to earn extra income from items they no longer need while helping others access goods at lower prices.

The system aims to modernize informal second‑hand trading by providing **secure communication, safe payment options, location‑based matching, and flexible exchange methods**.

## Problem Statement

- Safety and scam risks
- Lack of trust between buyers and sellers
